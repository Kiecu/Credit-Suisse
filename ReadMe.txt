Whole exercise took me a bit more than 4 hours, it includes:
 - setting up environment from scratch (Intellij, libs, etc)
 - finding gson lib
 - creating diagram
 - writting challange up to the current status


My comments:
I haven't writen Java code for over last 8 years (Collibra is based on Java - but my role was different there, inside Credit-Suissed I've worked with .Net projects)
I would add to my work
 - Setup connection with HSQLDB and add code to handle it
 - Acceptance Test that include db connection
 - Unit Tests for DB
 - Optimize method that find pairs
